# Bridge-Structural-Integrity-Forecast-Engine
TODO:Briefly describe the purpose/result(s) of your project, the skills you applied, and the Apply AI program.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Describe the motivation for this project, why it is relevant, and what its impacts are.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Given the substantial daily output of responses, the identification and mitigation of ChatGPT's biases become critical, safeguarding both the multitude of users and the far-reaching consequences they may influence.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
