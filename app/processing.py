"""
Processing module for BridgeSense Streamlit application.

This module loads the list of expected model columns and defines
`transform_data` for preprocessing user input. It handles missing
values by imputing medians or setting missing flags for specific
features. It also computes engineered features (interaction terms) to
mirror the training pipeline.

# If the file is missing, model_columns will remain empty and
# transform_data will raise an error when called.
try:
    # Load model columns from joblib and convert to a plain list.  If the
    # saved object is a pandas Index or other iterable, casting to list
    # prevents ambiguous truth value errors when checking emptiness.

# When any of these features is missing from user input, its value
